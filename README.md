## Description

The following application is a node CLI that creates a software development team consistent of a manager, as many engineers of your choosing and as many interns of your choosing. Once the user has completed the requirements, an team.html document is created that illustrates the entire software development team. Classes were created in order to pass jest testing before continuing on with the development of the team, as highlighted in the videos in the links below.

## User-Story

As a manager,
I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info,
so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles.
When I run the testing in the terminal,
Testing for all classes are passed. 
When I run the application, 
I am prompted with Manager details first,
followed by a choice between creating input for Engineer or Intern details.
When I complete Engineer or Intern details, 
I have the option to select Engineer or Intern again to create a new profile for another employee. 
When I have completed my team and choose to finish,
an output in .html format is generated highlighting the team. 

## Installation
Type npm install in the terminal with the correct working directory

## Usage 
After typing 'node app.js', answer the following prompts and after completion a team.html file will be created in the output folder with your software development team.

## Tests
Type 'npm run test' in the command line to ensure that all tests for the classes pass (using jest)
